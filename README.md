 How to Run My Code
 1. Decompress the File
 2. User Terminal/Command Prompt to change directories into the project folder
 3. Type ‘python run.py’ to run
        a. Options for which algorithm to use will be given once the program is run
 4. Note: Results are written to the same directory as run.py. If you want to run multiple tests & save all the results, you would need to manually move the .txt files to another folder of your choice.
